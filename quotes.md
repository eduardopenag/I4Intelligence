"memes should be considered as living structures, not just metaphorically"[12] and proposed to regard memes as "physically residing in the brain" N. K. Humphrey

"Intelligence measures an agentâ€™s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments." [S. Legg and M. Hutter]

"Most if not all AI problems can be formulated within the agent framework" Marcus Hutter
"Reinforcement Learning is Extremely General works in animals, humans, robots, and software agents"

"**No Intelligence without Goals.** Most, if not all known facets of intelligence can be formulated as goal driven or, more generally, as maximizing some utility function. It is, therefore, sufficient to study goal driven AI. E.g. the (biological) goal of animals and humans is to survive and spread. The goal of AI systems should be to be useful to humans. The problem is that, except for special cases, we know neither the utility function, nor the environment in which the system will operate, in advance.
