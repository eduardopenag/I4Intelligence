# I4Intelligence
I4Intelligence or I for Intelligence is a personal blog about a speculative  intelligent entity with is evolving on planet earth.

This project has two objevctives:

1. The main objective is of couse try to describe "I",
2. But it is also an exercise to write a Jupyter and Github based, open source, collaborative book 

# I Overview

Trough this book we will try to describe what is "I", but in principle, it can be defined as a virtual intelligence which use our brains, our computers and our telecomunication network to store and process information and knowledge. It is an independent entity very likely pushed by similar rules of darwinian evolution which was born in living organism and seems to be traying to move ahead.
