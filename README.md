# I4Intelligence
I4Intelligence or I for Intelligence is a personal blog about a speculative intelligent entity with is evolving on planet earth.

# I Overview

Trough this book we will try to describe what is "I", but in principle, it can be defined as a virtual intelligence which use our brains, our computers and our telecomunication network to store and process information and knowledge. It is an independent entity very likely pushed by similar rules of darwinian evolution which was born in living organism and seems to be traying to move ahead.

This book is not about AI and the singularity, it is about I (just Intelligence) no mater if it Artificial or Natural.
It is more about Richard Dawkins [MEMES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme): I is a set of memes that have been gaining power, adapting, surviving, and which decide that human brains are not enought, but are the best it has now.
